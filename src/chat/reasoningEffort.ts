/**
 * Reasoning-effort resolution helpers.
 *
 * Kept in their own module so the chat request handler can stay focused on
 * streaming, and so the resolution rules can be unit-tested without
 * standing up the full `vscode` runtime (the chat handler imports many
 * `vscode` symbols that the test runner doesn't load).
 *
 * The picker drives this by setting `modelConfiguration.reasoningEffort` on
 * the chat request — that's the field Copilot Chat writes when the user
 * picks a value in the "Thinking Effort" sub-selector rendered from the
 * `configurationSchema` we attach to `LanguageModelChatInformation` (see
 * microsoft/vscode#315181). The chat handler reads it back out here and
 * forwards the result on the OpenAI request body as `reasoning_effort`.
 * The value is also accepted as `modelOptions.reasoningEffort`,
 * `modelOptions.reasoning_effort` (snake_case), and via
 * `perModelOptions` / `extraModelOptions` to preserve the existing
 * settings.json escape hatch.
 *
 * Valid values mirror the GitHub Copilot SDK's `ReasoningEffort` union
 * added in https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/pull/302 — only
 * `low / medium / high / xhigh` are forwarded. Anything outside that set
 * is dropped so the request never trips a 400 on the upstream provider.
 */

/**
 * Mirrors `ReasoningEffort` from `github/copilot-sdk` PR #302. Forwarded on
 * the request body as `reasoning_effort`; any value outside this set is
 * treated as "not specified" and the field is omitted.

 *
 * Precedence: `modelConfiguration` (the picker) > `optionsModelOptions` >
 * `perModelOptions` > `extraModelOptions`. Both `reasoningEffort` (camelCase,
 * matches the Copilot SDK's `SessionConfig.reasoningEffort` field) and
 * `reasoning_effort` (snake_case, the raw wire-format key) are accepted so
 * the value can be set via either the picker or a `perModelOptions`
 * override.
 *
 * The returned value is the canonical wire form: lowercase, drawn from the
 * {@link ReasoningEffort} union. The literal strings `"none"`, `"off"`, and
 * any other value outside the union are dropped — GitHub Copilot's
 * `/v1/chat/completions` returns 400 on `"none"` for models that don't
 * accept it, and 9Router itself strips it (decolua/9router PR #791). The
 * legacy `"max"` value is also dropped because it is not part of the
 * Copilot SDK's union (the closest supported level is `"xhigh"`).
